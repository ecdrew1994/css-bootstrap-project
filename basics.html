            <p>STAY CONSISTENT:</p>

            <p>I can not reiterate this enough to
              everyone. Staying consistent is extremely important for progress. This will
              help you form the habits and in turn going to the gym just becomes apart of your
              day rather than something you need to force yourself to do. There are additional
              benefits, as well. Consistentcy is what will let you see those results that you will,
              ineveitably, work so hard for. This is my top tip for anything and everything related
              to your fitness journey. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>AIM TO GET "STRONGER":</p>

            <p>This is extremely important and there is a word
              that is associated with aiming to get "stronger". It's called progressive overload.
              To put it simply, as long as there is some improvement: 1 more rep than last time,
              5 more pounds than before, shorter rest time, etc. Then you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span>
              make progress. It will be slow and there will be times that you may not think you
              made progress and that is because progress takes time, just keep
              pushing and things will happen for you, I promise.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>STRETCH, STRETCH AND STRETCH MORE:</p>

            <p>Guys and gals, stretching is just as important as the actualy lifting. It's also really
              good for your health. Now, I know there are a lot of people out there that are probably
              thinking, "Evan, what about warming up?". Well, there is something called dynamic stretching.
              It's basically warming up and stretching combined. It also keeps you from over-stretching, which
              can actually lead to a potential injury during the lift. At the end of your workout you can, at that point,
              do static stretching. This is just normal stretching and it's a good time to actually improve your flexability,
              as well. Aside from this, stretching will help prevent injury and trust me, injury sucks for your consistentcy.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li class="basics-card-ol">
          <h3>Eat!</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>LESS OR MORE?:</p>

            <p>So, your eating will be based on the goals that you wish to achieve.
              Based on that you may eat more calories or less calories. Just FYI eating
              less calories <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span>
              mean you eat less food, you can eat just as much as you do now and still reach your
              goals. It's about the qaulity of food that you eat.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>TRACK YOUR PROGRESS:</p>

            <p>If you want to see results faster, then tracking what you consume is a
              great idea. Now, I know this can seem like a lot of work and it can make people
              feel unmotivated. Don't let tracking your food sway you, honestly...it can be super simple
              and you don't have to get super specific with the things you do. Counting calories is just as
              effective as tracking all your macros and micros. It really isn't neccesary to track all the
              specific macros and micros unless you are competing. Again, as long as your food quality
              is good then you will hit the macros you need anyways. So keep it simple!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>QUALITY OF FOOD:</p>

            <p>You have probably noticed that I keep mentioning the quality of your food.
              It is because it is just as important as the rest of the tips. If you are solely
              trying to track just calories then the qaulity of your food is going to be important.
              Choosing the foods that are going to help you reach your specific goal is important. So choose
              meats that are lean and high in protein, choose those vegtables over the chips, etc. You understand
              the gist. In doing this, you will increase the quality of food and recieve more nutrients for your goals.
              Not to mention, the higher quality foods tend to be less calorically dense so naturally, you can eat more, if
              you want and still reach those goals of yours. Again, all that is determined on your particular goals and to
              get specific with it, you would first have to know those goals.</p>

          <h3>Recovery!</h3>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>SLEEP:</p>

            <p>Sleep is extremely important for recovery. This is going to be at
            the top of my list for you. Getting consistent and proper amounts of
          sleep is going to increase your recovery and the faster that you can recover
        the quicker you can workout that muscle again and improve it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>SERVICES:</p>

            <p>There are a multitude of services that exist to help with recovery.
            If you have the funds, then finding a service that helps in aiding with
          recovery, go for it! Cryotherapy, massages, sauana, etc. There are a lot of
        options for everyone.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>AT HOME:</p>

            <p>So if you don't want to spend a ton of money then an alternative to
            services that you can pay for. You can just do a simple ice bath. Go to the
          store and get yourself a few bags of ice and dump it in a bathtub. Do a nice
        10 minute session and you're good to go. I advise doing some research into this
      before going through with it.</p>
