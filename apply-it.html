              <p>WHICH DIRECTION - GAIN OR LOSE?:</p>

              <p>Truth be told, it really depends on you. Where do you see yourself, how do you want to look.
              I mean, think about it. You have your powerlifters that are more heavier set and there are
            people who absolutely would love to rock that look. Others may want to rock the shredded, lean
          look, or perhaps they are there for performance reasons. Your goals determine this question. Now, if
        you want to gain weight, then you need to eat more calories than you burn in a day. If you want to lose weight
      then you need to eat less calories than you burn in a day. How do you do this? Well, once you start tracking, it
    is actually pretty easy. You select a goal for calories and eat that amount for about a week or two and measure your
  weight from the beggining and then again at the end. If you gained weight then lower the calories down by 100-200 calories
and go from there. Just do this until you find that sweet spot where you're losing at a moderate, consistent pace. They
say that a good goal is .5 - 1 lbs a week. If you want to gain weight, then just do the same thing but eat more instead.
Guys and gals, it's really that simple! </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>GET MORE SPECIFIC:</p>

              <p>Now that you've figured out whether you want to focus on gaining or losing. Set yourself up
              with an actual number that you want to hit. Have something tangible that you can focus on for yourself
            to reach. This should be done in short term and long term goals, have those short terms be easy and achievable
          that way you can keep your motivation and then your long term will keep you pushing passed those short term goals. Having
        the short term goals will serve to keep you motivated along the journey to reach your long term goal, essentially. Remember,
      this is a as much of a mental game as it is a physical. But you got this!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>DATE:</p>

              <p>The last step for your goals should be to have dates set that you want to actually reach your numbers
              that you set for yourself. This will give you that drive each day to know that you're just one step closer
            to hitting the next goal and then the one after that. Keep improving yourself and the results will come. </p>

            <h3>Program & Eating</h3>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>EATING:</p>

              <p>This is going to control a lot of the results that you achieve. Plain and simple, this is something
              that you and everyone else has to accept. If you can't get your diet together and tailor it to your goals then
            you really will not see the progress you were hoping for. So keep that in mind when you are setting goals for yourself.</p>

              <p>WORKOUT PROGRAM:</p>

              <p>If you're a newbie at lifting then I can promise that you probably have no idea where to even start. This is
              completely normal and try to not feel too overwhelmed, we all go through it and got through it. You will to, I promise.
            To start, I can go on about all the things you can do, but there is so much information that it would be too much for
          this page. However, there are a lot of amazing resources that you can check out. I'd personally recommend that you check out
        science based youtubers in the fitness industry because they actually do research into articles and scientific studies and cite
      all of their sources. I'm personally a big fan of Jeff Nippard and recommend checking him out and expanding from there. It's really
    that easy. Also, doing your own research into stuff will help you really learn and understand things before jumping into it. Good luck!</p>

              <p>HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK?:</p>

              <p>When you first start working out, if you are new, then you will be fairly sore starting out and will
              probably only be able to lift 2-3 times for the first few weeks. Once your body starts to adapt and recover
            quicker, you will be able to up that amount. It's good to start slow and take it easy when you are getting into
          it.</p>

              <p>FINAL TIP #1 - FORM:</p>

              <p>Form is extremely important and you should be focused on mastering form before you go really hard and
              throw on heavy weight. Injury is a real thing, not to mention, if you have better form then you are going to
            progress quicker and thus see better results.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>FINAL TIP #2 - MOTIVATION:</p>

              <p>There is going to be points in time that you are going to question yourself, there will be times when
              you are going to wonder if you even want to keep going to the gym. These are normal thoughts and we all have
            them because at the end of the day, we are all human. Don't beat yourself up too much for having thoughts like this. The
          best thing you can do for yourself is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just do it anyways</span>!</p>
